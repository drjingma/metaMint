This document introduces to you how to use the package **metaMint** for joint estimation of metabolite and microbial interaction network.

```{r setup}
library(metaMint)
library(dplyr)
library(GGally)
```

## Data

We use an example data set from @mcmillan2015multi that has 51 bacterial taxa and 128 metabolites measured over 131 samples. Taxonomic counts were obtained using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, whereas metabolite profiling was done by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 

```{r}
data(BV, package = "metaMint")
```

Before calling the package, it is important to preprocess the taxonomic count data which is subject to the total library size constraint. A common practice is to apply the centered log-ratio (clr) transformation. Briefly, for a vector $r$ with $p$ components, let $g(r)=(\Pi_{j=1}^p)^{1/p}$ denote its geometric mean. The clr of $r$ is defined as
\[
{\rm clr}(r) = \left( \log \frac{r_1}{g(r)},\ldots,\log \frac{r_p}{g(r)}\right)^\intercal.
\]
It is easy to see that the clr transformation does not allow zero counts. To address this issue, a small pseudocount of 0.5 or 1 is often added to all counts before applying the transformation. However, adding pseudocounts may unfairly bias rare species. 

To avoid introducing artificial bias, we use instead the modified-clr (mclr) transformation. The mclr transforms the
non-zero counts with the usual clr and shifts all transformed values to be strictly positive. Details on how mclr compares with clr transformation can be found in @yoon2019microbial. The following Figure illustrates the different marginal distributions one gets with clr and mclr transformation. The mclr transformed value can be modeled using a censored normal distribution, which provides the basis for our method. 

```{r clr,fig.cap='Illustration of how clr and mclr transformation affects the marginal distribution of one OTU.'}
OTUs_clr <- apply(OTUs,2,compositions::clr)
OTUs_mclr <- t(clr.epsilon(t(OTUs)))

ggpairs(data.frame(clr=OTUs_clr[22,],
                   mclr=OTUs_mclr[22,]),
        diag = list(continuous = "barDiag",binwidth = 0.5))
```

## Estimation 

With preprocessed data, we are now ready to show how to use the main functions in **metaMint**. One can use the function `cggm.corr` to estimate the correlations among bacterial taxa.

```{r cor,eval=FALSE}
est_Cor <- cggm.corr(t(OTUs_mclr))
```

Alternatively, if the interest is to learn the conditional association (as defined by partial correlations) among bacterial taxa, one can use the function `cggm.pcorr`. 

```{r invcor,eval=FALSE}
est_InvCor <- cggm.pcorr(t(OTUs_mclr))
```

The model underlying **metaMint** allows for both continuous and zero-inflated variables. Therefore, to jointly estimate the metabolite and microbial interaction network, one only needs to expand the input to include both types of measurements. 

```{r MINT,eval=FALSE}
dat_combined <- t(rbind(OTUs_mclr,metabs))
est_InvCor_combined <- cggm.pcorr(dat_combined)
```

## Model Selection

The function `cggm.stars` provides a way for selecting the optimal regularization parameter that controls the sparsity of the estimated partial correlation network. It is based on the idea of stability selection [@liu2010stability]. 

```{r stars,eval=FALSE}
est_InvCor <- cggm.pcorr(t(OTUs_mclr))
stars_obj <- cggm.stars(est_InvCor,stars.thresh = 0.1, rep.num = 20)
```

## Convenience Wrapper Function
To streamline the process of microbiome-metabolite network analysis, the metaMint package provides a convenient wrapper function `analyze_microbiome_metabolite_network`. 

This function unifies the preprocessing, inference, and result-saving steps into a single call. The results are saved as an .rds file in the subdirectory `data`, named according to the analysis method (e.g., `corr.rds`, `pcorr.rds`, or `corr_test.rds`).

### Required Inputs

To run `analyze_microbiome_metabolite_network`, you must provide:

- `X`: a `p × n` matrix of microbiome feature abundances, where `p` is the number of microbial features (e.g., taxa or ASVs) and `n` is the number of samples.  
- `Y`: a `q × n` matrix of metabolite abundances, where `q` is the number of metabolite features and `n` matches the number of samples in `X`.  
- `method`: a character string indicating the type of analysis to perform. Must be one of:
  - `corr`: marginal correlation analysis  
  - `pcorr`: partial correlation using graphical lasso  
  - `corr_test`: correlation testing with FDR correction and network modeling via stochastic block models (SBM)  

### Optional Parameters

Depending on the selected method, several optional parameters can be specified:

**For method = `pcorr`:**

- `lambda`: a numeric vector of regularization parameters for graphical lasso. If not provided, a default sequence is computed based on the data dimensions: `seq(0.1, 3, 0.1) * sqrt(log(nrow(X) + nrow(Y)) / ncol(X)`.

**For method = `corr_test`:**

- `zscore_method`: how to compute the test statistics. One of:
  - `pearson+fisher`: Pearson correlation followed by Fisher transformation  
  - `spearman+fisher`: Spearman correlation followed by Fisher transformation  
  - `CL`: Cai & Liu test statistic using a variance-stabilized form (default if `zscore_method` not provided)
- `alpha`: significance threshold for FDR-adjusted p-values (default: `0.05`)  
- `sbm_model`: distributional assumptions for the SBM. One of:
  - `Gauss0`: null mean is 0 (default if `sbm_model` not provided)
  - `Gauss01`: null is standard normal N(0, 1)  
  - `Gauss02distr`: null mean is 0; alternative modeled as a single Gaussian  
- `sbm_params`: a list of SBM model selection parameters:
  - `Q1`: vector of candidate numbers of microbiome clusters  
  - `Q2`: vector of candidate numbers of metabolite clusters  
  - `explor`: exploration factor used for model comparison  
- `nb_cores`: number of CPU cores to use for parallel SBM fitting. If not provided, all available cores are used.

### Output

The function returns a named list, which depends on the selected method:

- For `method = "corr"`:
  - `result.corr`: a `(p+q) × (p+q)` matrix of marginal Pearson correlations.

- For `method = "pcorr"`:
  - `result.pcorr`: a `(p+q) × (p+q)` matrix of partial correlations estimated using graphical lasso.

- For `method = "corr_test"`:
  - `result.corr_test`: a `p × q` matrix of FDR-adjusted p-values  
  - `microbiome_clusters`: cluster assignments for microbial features  
  - `metabolite_clusters`: cluster assignments for metabolites
  
### Examples
Below, we first run the wrapper function using the method `corr_test`: 
```{r}
data(BV, package = "metaMint")

result <- analyze_microbiome_metabolite_network(
  X = OTUs,
  Y = metabs,
  method = "corr_test",
  save_dir = "~/test",
  zscore_method = "CL",
  sbm_model = "Gauss0",
  alpha = 0.05,
  sbm_params = list(Q1 = 1:5, Q2 = 1:5, explor = 1.5),
  nb_cores = 4
)

# Inspect the FDR-adjusted matrix
head(result$result.corr_test)

# Inspect Metabolite clusters
result$metabolite_clusters

# Inspect Microbiome clusters
result$microbiome_clusters
```
We can then visualize the results with `visualize_network_heatmap`, which saves the plot to `./corr_test.pdf`. 
```{r}
visualize_network_heatmap(result, 
                          adjacency_threshold=0.05,
                          save_pdf="corr_test.pdf",
                          rownames_size=10,
                          colnames_size=6)
```

We next run an example using the method `corr`. Here, we subset the data since this method takes quite some time to run (around an hour). 
```{r}
data(BV, package = "metaMint")

result <- analyze_microbiome_metabolite_network(
  X = OTUs[1:10, 1:10],
  Y = metabs[1:10, 1:10],
  method = "corr",
  save_dir = "~/test",
)

# Inspect the correlation matrix
head(result$result.corr)

visualize_network_heatmap(result, 
                          adjacency_threshold = 10^-6,
                          save_pdf="corr.pdf",
                          rownames_size=10,
                          colnames_size=10)

```

Finally, we do the same using the `pcorr` method:

```{r}
data(BV, package = "metaMint")

result <- analyze_microbiome_metabolite_network(
  X = OTUs[1:10, 1:10],
  Y = metabs[1:10, 1:10],
  method = "pcorr",
  save_dir = "~/test",
  lambda = seq(0.1, 3, 0.1) * sqrt(log(10 + 10) / 10)
)

# Inspect the correlation matrix
head(result$result.pcorr)

visualize_network_heatmap(result, 
                          adjacency_threshold = 10^-6,
                          save_pdf="pcorr.pdf",
                          rownames_size=10,
                          colnames_size=10)


```
